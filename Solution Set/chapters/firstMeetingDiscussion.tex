\chapter{First Meeting Discussion}

\subsubsection*{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item For the first phase, we meet several times to modify the style. For the next phase, I discuss PhD students to make sure solutions are correct and concise.
\item For version 1.0, I will simply copy the exercise statements. But many of them heavily depend on the context. After finishing the main part, I will come back to this. Or we can simply include only solution and exercise index.
\item It is better to have a label for each exercise so that you can freely add or delete them.
\item In the homework, commands of \LaTeX and \TeX are mixed.
\item Maybe add a Theorem collection or index.
\item In Page 71, I think it's better to write $B$ instead of $B(\tau)$ because it is not the standard form of convolution, although they lead to the same result.
\item In Page 71, I think you mean ``In some cases this can be done directly from the \textbf{finite} series''.
\item In Page 74, may be use symmetric instead of diagnoal?
\item Is Definitioin 5.1 rigorous?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Am I going to have a position in the office?
\item You corrected typos with an additional document instead of fixing them in the lecture notes. Is there something wrong with the source file?
\item What is the difference between ``linear in $u$ and $x$'' and ``linear jointly in $u$ and $x$''?
\item When does the system diverge exponentially?
\item Is the script your work or student's work?
\item What does $\{u_j\}_{j=1}^n \xrightarrow[]{A \in F^{m \times n}} \{v_i\}_{i=1}^m$ mean?
\end{itemize}
